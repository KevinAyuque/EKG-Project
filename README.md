This is the code used to pre-process the data. To get access to the data please consult with the professor, he asked not to share it. For training, go to https://drive.google.com/file/d/1InbP-TNh1YGKncOkRlJm6kzNsMxgPIa_/view?usp=sharing

1. Run data_Y.py (This looks at the data and classifies it based on the criteria)

`python data_Y.py data_raw/jsonfiles ps -v`

2. Run data_X.py (This looks at the files_name generated by data_Y and outputs a matrix of waveform data.)

0 -> waveform size 300
1 -> waveform size 2500

`python data_X.py out_PS data_raw/jsonfiles 0 -v`
